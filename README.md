# Leap-Animatronic-Hand
Code and Assets for Building an Animatronic Hand Controlled By Leap Motion


Note: The files in the CSharpCodeForReference folder exist so the code can be viewed without importing the Unity Package. You do not need to use those files for anything if you are building this project. 

You'll need to set your project to use .NET 4 to fix the Serial related issues. In Unity, go to Edit>Project Settings>Player>Other Settings and change API Compatibility Level to .NET 4.x.

Also, make sure you have the Leap SDK package in your Unity project. See the walkthrough linked below.
